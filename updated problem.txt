Feature: Multiple styles of volume discounts

The system already handles items that are cheaper when sold in certain
quantities but sell at their individual price when sold "loose."

We also want to sell some items that should have volume discounts applied as
long as the customer buys more than a threshold quantity. There's no "penalty"
for buying odd quantities of these items.

For example, the type of item we already handle works like this:
A G costs 1.00 each, but they're available in cases of 10 for 9.00 a case, so:
  | Quantity             | Total |
  | G                    | 1.00  |
  | GGG                  | 3.00  |
  | GGGGGGGGGG (10 Gs)   | 9.00  |
  | GGGGGGGGGGGG (12 Gs) | 11.00 |

Whereas the new type of item we want to handle should work like this:
An F costs 1.00 each, but only 0.90 each when buying 10 or more, so:
  | Scanned items        | Total |
  | F                    | 1.00  | <-- Same as G
  | FFF                  | 3.00  | <-- Same as G
  | FFFFFFFFFF (10 Fs)   | 9.00  | <-- Same as G
  | FFFFFFFFFFFF (12 Fs) | 10.80 | <-- Different from G
